### Daily Approach

## Conflict Plan

_What will be your groupâ€™s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?_

We'll get together and discuss our concerns in a respectful manner

_What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not 
letting the other members contribute?_

We'll take a step back and refocus on our objective. Then we'll delegate 
responsibilities to compensate.

_How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing
that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in
understanding and skill level?_

By being understanding and willing to help each other when needed.

_How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?_

Ask them about their current progress, then possibly suggest less challenging 
tasks for them to contribute to.

_How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts
are unsuccessful?_

Escalating conflict is not an option.

## Communication Plan

_What hours will you be available to communicate?_

9am-3pm and 6pm-12am

_What platforms will you use to communicate?_

Slack, Discord, and Remo

_How often will you take breaks?

Every 1-2 hrs

_How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?_

Just occasionally updating our status on our tasks

_What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voice is heard?_

Genuinely consider everyone's opinion. Don't talk over others. Actively listen 
to others.

_How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone 
feels confortable speaking up?_

Being respectful, understanding, kind, and relaxed.
