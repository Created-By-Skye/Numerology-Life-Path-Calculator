# Numerology Life Path Calculator

By: Skye McCullough, Brandon Keefer, and Eddie Ewell III

In this app, our team combined concepts we learned throughout our Code-301 course to create a Life Path Calculator! To use the calculator, just sign up for an account and from there you can create a profile for yourself and your loved ones! 
<br />
Once you create your profile, we will use the provided birth date to calculate your life path number! To do this, we created a script in using JavaScript to reduce all of the numbers in your date of birth by adding them all together. This process is repeated until we reach a single digit, OR we reach a *master number* which includes the numbers 11, 22, and 33.
<br />
 After we calculate the life path number, you can read the description of your number by clicking the 'life paths' link. This 'life path number' has been coined in several different cultures by multiple people throughout history under the umbrella term: *Numerology*. We hope you enjoy reading a little bit about this mystic topic and that you resonate with your life path!
