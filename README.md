# 301-group-project-final
Final group project for code 301

* Teams will agree on an app idea `make sure to select something that can be completed by end of day Thursday`
* Project should support CRUD+1 functionality for managing selected content and consist of BOTH a React Frontend and a node.js/express backend
* Content should be persisted in MongoDB
* Basic authentication should be implemented on the frontend to require a user to be signed in before accessing pages that allow the user to change the database (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE)
* Viewing a list of records and/or viewing an individual record should not require authentication
  * NOTE server side authentication/authorization is NOT required for this project but teams are free to implement if they have time
* Each team should select one person to be responsible for submitting project status reports for the team however ALL team members must provide input
